Black Americans, on the other hand, are more likely to have African American Vernacular English as their native language. Accents and language variations between the two groups can be distinctive and distinct. \n\nDress and fashion is also a noticeable difference between the two cultures. With many historically oppressed minorities in America, African Americans have embraced and developed a rich cultural heritage of self-expression through dress and fashion. Many elements of black style, such as natural hairstyles, jewelry, accessories, tailored suits, and distinctive hairstyles, have become important fixtures in American popular culture.\n\nThe leisure activities and entertainment preferred by the black and white cultures also vary. Music, for example, is an important unifying force for black Americans. Soul music and black gospel have shaped the culture and music preferences of African Americans for centuries. Meanwhile, popular music genres like jazz and rock are largely white cultural creations. \n\nWhen it comes to values, beliefs, and perspectives, the black and white cultures in America have differing traditions and backgrounds. Both communities have distinct moral, spiritual and ethical perspectives shaped by unique and diverse histories. Generally, however, the black culture is more traditionally rooted in Christian denominations while the white culture tends to have more individualistic viewpoints.\n\nFinally, the arts of music, literature, and visual art vary between these two ethnic groups in the United States. African American culture, being a mix of several influences, has produced some of the world's greatest jazz, blues, funk and soul music. Meanwhile, Western classical and modern music forms the mainstay of white popular culture.
